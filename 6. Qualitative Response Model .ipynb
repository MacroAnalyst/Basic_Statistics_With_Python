    "So we have only discussed the model that takes $Y$ as a quantitative variable by default, however there are situations we want $Y$ to be qualitative variable, for example, $Y = 1$ represents a family owns house, $Y=0$ means not owning a house, independent variables can be quantitative variables such as their income, ages, education and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, if the response variables only takes two values, such as $1$ or $0$, we call them **binary variable**, the regression model with binary variable as dependent variable is called **binary response regression model**, similarly there is also **trichotomous response regression model** or more generally **polychotomous response regression model**, but names do not matter, they are all **qualitative response model** as in the question of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For easy demonstration, we will mostly deal with _binary response model_, there are four approaches to develop this type of model: **linear probability model**, **logit model**, **probit model** and **tobit model**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through all of them in this chapter."
