# Basic Statistics With Python
This is a series of lecture notes that I prepared in my statistics tutorial, which are supposed to be concise and straightforward, withouth any unnecessary proofs or derivation. 

## Who Can Benifit From These Notes
Perfect for university students who wants to have quick walkthrough of core structure of **frequentist statistics**, also very beneficial for practioners, such as junior quantitative analysts, who wants to refresh their knowledge as fast as possible (i.e. within 3 days). All the practices in the notes are demonstrated by Python, including all figures and charts.

## Prerequisites
Though the lectures are introductory level, it would be ideal that attendants have a slight exposure to probability theory.

And also the attendants are expected to have basic knowledge (3 days training would be enough) of 
- [x] Python
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] Pandas
