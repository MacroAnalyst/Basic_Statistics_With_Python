# Basic Statistics With Python

## Who Can Benifit From These Notes
This is a series of lecture notes that I prepared in my statistics tutorial, which is concise and straightforward, withouth any unnecessary proofs or derivation. Perfect for university students who wants to have quick walkthrough of core structure of **frequentist statistics**, also very beneficial for practioners, such as junior quantitative analysts, who wants to refresh their knowledge just within one or two days. All the practices in the notes are demonstrated by Python, including all figures and charts.

## Prerequisites
Though the lectures are introductory level, it would be ideal that attendants have a slight exposure to probability theory.

And also the attendants are expected to have basic knowledge (3 days training would be enough) of 
- [x] Python
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] Pandas
